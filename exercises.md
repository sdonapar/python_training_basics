# Exercise 1
* ## Generate a list of packages installed in your miniconda3 distribution
* ## Source-1
    * ### 'pip freeze' command list all of the packages installed, redirect the output to a file
* ## Source-2
    * ### After activating the virtual env, change directory to $CONDA_PREFIX
    * ### Miniconda insallation has a directory #CONDA_PEEFIX/lib/python3.7/site-packages
    * ### The above directory contains a directory for each package, generate a package list using directory names
* ### Compare both the packages and their versions and find the differences between Source-1 and Source-2


# Exercise 2
* ## Write a function that returs a boolean if a given number is happy number
* ## Here is more information on what is a happy number

## A **happy number** is a number defined by the following process: 
* ### Starting with any **positive integer**, replace the number by the **sum of the squares of its digits**, and repeat the process until the number either equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while those that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers
